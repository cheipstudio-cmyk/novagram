 * Vendored Phosphor Bold icons (https://phosphoricons.com — MIT). Every

 * weight; the [PathParser] turns it into a Compose [ImageVector] at first
 * access. Using the path data verbatim (rather than reconstructing in
 * PathBuilder DSL) keeps the file compact and the geometry faithful to
 * the upstream design — no manual approximations.
 *
 * Tinting works the standard way via `Icon(tint = …)` because the base
 * fill is opaque black and `Icon` overrides via `ColorFilter`.
